# SWA_Git
This repository is used as source for the teaching of SWA. It provides just a basic website example.

The Website is just a simple D3 visualization where changes can be made. The main three files here are:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js

## Usage
The website can be just opened as it is in the browser or using "Hot Reloading" which requires you to run `npm install` and then the command `lite-server` assuming you previously have installed *lite-server* globally. 

### Global installation of lite-server
`npm install -g lite-server`


*Have fun*
